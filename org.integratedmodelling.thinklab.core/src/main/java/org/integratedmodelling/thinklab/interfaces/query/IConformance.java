/**
 * Conformance objects are "policies" for comparing
 * instances. The conformance idea is used to recognize the fact that two
 * instance may be equivalent or not according to the particular context of the
 * comparison. For example, in the context of model/data mediation we may be
 * comparing two observations that are done differently (e.g. at different
 * resolutions) but in fact observe the same thing in the same context and thus
 * should be considered equal when mediation is enabled. By defining the details
 * of the comparison into an appropriate conformance policy, we enable
 * comparison exactly the way it is intended.
 * 
 * Because conformance policies work by returning a Constraint that selects the
 * instances that conform to a passed one, it is possible to use a conformance
 * policy as a query generator to retrieve all the conformant instances from a
 * kBox.
