/**
 * <p>
 * Instances are the "objects" in the knowledge base. Instances can be contained
 * in the shared knowledge base (and retrieved through the knowledge manager),
 * in Sessions (where they can be added and retrieved directly) and in KBoxes
 * (where they are added and retrieved directly or through queries). In these
 * docs, the words "Instance" and "Object" are used interchangeably.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> you're not supposed to create an instance directly. Only an
 * appropriate container (e.g. a Session) can do that, either on request through
 * the API or as the result of a load operation. If created through the API, an
 * instance won't be part of the container until validated (see below).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances can have a Java "implementation" which is created by the
 * appropriate concept manager after successful validation, if a concept manager
 * with a constructor is defined for the class or one of its parents. This
 * provides the instance with arbitrary Java content that implementations can
 * use as necessary.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances are the only knowledge objects that can be created through the API.
 * It is required to validate an instance after it's been defined, or the
 * implementation will not be created. Classes implementing IInstance should be
 * able to distinguish non-validated instances and refuse to use, store, and
 * make them visible through the retrieval interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The IMA Instance definition interface provides (I believe) the simplest
 * paradigm to creating knowledge through an API. Relationships are classified
 * into three possible classes and methods are provided for each of them. OWL
 * underpinnings are dealt with transparently and OWL-DL compatibility is
 * preserved even in OWL-FULL constructs (e.g. classification relationships).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to representing knowledge, instances are also capable of
 * executing commands and this functionality interfaces with the IMA-supported
 * expression languages in ways that depend on the implementation.
 * </p>
