/**
 * Queries in thinklab return knowledge, of course, and they may use a "schema"
 * to specify things that we want to know about these objects. Typically we
 * don't want query result to contain initialized objects but we want the query
 * to return either elements from the result schema or list representations that
 * objects can be created from. So we do not pass sessions to any of these
 * methods. Query results should store the queriable and the query so that paged
 * access is possible without having to go back to the queriables.
