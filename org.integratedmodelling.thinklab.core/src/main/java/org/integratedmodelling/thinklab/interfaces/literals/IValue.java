/**
 * <p>
 * A generalized container for a value that always has a concept associated. The
 * value may be defined from a literal or a basic type, or be a concept or an
 * instance in itself. It's the most general idea of a value, but it has an
 * unbreakable association to the knowledge base.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Value can have a value (oh yes), which simply means that a Java object
 * can be associated to the concept and represent an instance implementation,
 * substituting a full Instance object with properties. Typically this applies
 * to objects that are created from literals and belong to simple types, such as
 * text or numbers, although more complex ones (e.g. JTS shapes) are also
 * possible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The value may be as multiple as necessary, e.g. a Collection or a Polylist,
 * as long as the associated concept is unambiguous in suggesting that. If the
 * multiplicity depends on the properties, then a full Instance should be used.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The least a Value can do is to be a Concept, so the base Value class is
 * exactly that, and even the trivial constructor assigns a concept (the most
 * general one) to it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By its own nature, a Value is perfect to implement a stack for a complex
 * language or a return type for any action. In fact, it's used exactly for
 * these purposes in JIMT, along with storage of literals in relationships.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Efficiency of the approach is not maximal, obviously, but if you want it
 * efficient, use the C++ implementation, not this one. On the other hand, the
 * C++ implementation WILL drive you crazy, and this probably won't, unless
 * you're crazy already.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The IMA core provides implementations of numbers, text, booleans, concepts
 * and object(instance) values. These should be enough for a lot of
 * applications, given that some degree of polymorphism is provided by the
 * concept side. Other packages (e.g. time and space) provide more. Note that
 * implementing a Value subclass, unless limited to specialization of the
 * associated concept, isn't trivial due to handling of operators, cloning, and
 * proper checking methods, so should be done carefully.
 * </p>
