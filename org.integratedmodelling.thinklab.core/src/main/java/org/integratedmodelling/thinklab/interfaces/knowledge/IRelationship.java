 * <p>We use relationships to simplify the frame-based Concept interface. All the relationships that a class or instance
 * entertains with anything are returned as IRelationship objects. These can be queried to check if the relationship
 * is actually just the assertion of a property (like in most Concepts) or actually has a value, which can be a
 * literal (of any kind supported by the IMA), an object (instance), or a class (no matter whether we're using
 * OWL-DL or not).</p>
