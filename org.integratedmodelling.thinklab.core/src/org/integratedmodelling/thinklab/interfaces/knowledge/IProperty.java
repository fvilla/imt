/**
 * The interface for a Property. 
 *
 * Most of the interface is meant to check the subtype of property we're dealing with. Some of the
 * available subtypes are standard in OWL, others (such as classification) are IMA-specific and are 
 * normally figured out by checking whether the property inherits by specific upper ontology ones. 
 * 
 * Also, for now we just ignore functionality, simmetry, transitivity etc, given that the reasoner 
 * operates on the underlying OWL model. We'll see if they're needed.

     * look for (and create if necessary) a special unique instance of the class. The target of the relationship will

     * literal's definition. The API will create validated Values and not instances for these instances, using the
     * validator configured for the type, and I/O to ontologies will handle them transparently.
