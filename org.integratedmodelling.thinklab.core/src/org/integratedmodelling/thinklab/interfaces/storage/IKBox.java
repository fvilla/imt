/**
 * <p>Objects implementing IKBox contain instances and support insertion, retrieval, deletion and query. In general, they are optimized for
 * large storage and fast query, contrary to Ontologies. The IKBox (for Knowledge
 * Box, as a slightly friendlier version of the more proper "Assertion Box" or abox) can be implemented in any way, usually on top of a
 * RDBMS, XML database, or other RDF store. KBoxes and their content are always identified by a URL, and the Knowledge Manager
 * must be taught how to interpret each URL protocol as a kbox plug-in and create the kbox from it.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An Ontology is a proper implementation of a KBox but typically not an efficient one. On a KBox, we expect support of indexing,
 * transparent permanent storage, distributed access, and configurable query paradigms that can be extended to support literals of
 * various kinds (e.g. GIS operations on shapes). Full reasoning is not an option as it is not realistic to expect to compute the
 * semantic closure of a large collection. On the other hand, many operations that are done using reasoners on an Abox can be 
 * replicated with properly constructed Constraints.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each kbox is identified by a URI which must be enough for the system to understand what class to use to access it. For this
 * reason, the KM has methods that can match a plug-in handler class to the protocol identifier of the URI. The rest of the URI contains
 * access and configuration information that is passed to the kbox for "handshaking" with the KM. The fragment part of the URI can be
 * used to identify an object within the KBox.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>Once installed in the KM, a KBox gets its own ID and a semantic type is all it takes to obtain one of its instances from the KM. The
 * query method of the KM uses all the installed KBoxes unless one is mentioned specifically, and merges results. A priority can be
 * specified to define which kboxes should be searched first when the search is bounded to a specified max number of results.</p>
