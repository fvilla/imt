/**
 * The most high-level notion in Thinklab. Essentially a query that returns 
 * observations of a concept given a kbox and a session. It is nothing but a set
 * of axioms, and it should be serializable to an appropriately restricted
 * observation class; it is here represented as a Java class for practical
 * reasons (of efficiency, storage and cleanup of unneeded axioms); make it a
 * IConceptualizable to implement the behavior if needed, it's likely to be
 * unneeded overhead for now.
 * 
 * The Java side is usable as is but the whole model definition machinery is
 * meant to be used from Clojure, which provides an elegant and compact syntax for
 * model specification. See the examples/ folder in the plugin directory.
 * 
 * More docs will come or I'm not a real academic...
